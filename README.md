# Antonio Cozzolino Portfolio

This GitHub contains some personal coding projects. There are several example of code produced in different programming languages, main are: Python, Matlab, R, Julia. The repository is still work in progress so some section may be not yet complete.

Here is a little description of the folders in the repository.

## 1. Bachelor Thesis
Brief translation of the work

## 2. Master Thesis
Title: Skill Heterogeneity, Idiosyncratic Risk, and Labor Market Fluctuations. 

Abstract: This thesis studies the effects of skill heterogeneity and non-pecuniary motives on job selection at an aggregate level. I formulate a Dynamic Discrete Choice Model that considers households’ choices related to occupation, consumption, and saving. Within this framework, agents’ decision
rules exhibit discontinuities. The interplay of these factors have an impact on job mobility patterns, leading to shifts in labor supply and aggregate movements similar to TFP shocks. 

The Matlab codes are the original one used for the thesis. Julia codes instead are a re-implementation that allows for Parallelization and Interpolation of the Value Function of the model. The Julia Code is a work in progress, I'm moving the code there since I'm planning to do an estimation exercise of the model. 

## 3. Robust Identification and Inference in Repeated Games
This is a joint work with Cristina Gualdani, Niccolò Lomys and Lorenzo Magnolfi. It's a sample code extracted and simplified from the Python Library I'm developing for the estimation procedure. Unfortunately the working paper has not circulated yet, therefore I decided to publish an example of estimation of a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma.

## 4. Data Analysis
This section contains some data tasks example from "predoc.org". It contains the exercise and the code. In the "Data Manipulation Medicare Advantage" exercise I show some code in R that involves a simple data cleaning and dataset creation.

The "Economic Analysis" exercise instead is more involved, and requires to use a subsample from "U.S. Current Population Survey" to produce an answer to the question of how hourly wages (“wage”) and labor force participation (“lfp”) evolved for skilled and unskilled workers since 1976.

## 5. ANN and Function Approximation

This folder contains some example of code I produced about Neural Networks for Function Approximation.

## 6. Computational Economics

This folder contains Value Function Approximation performed with Julia. There is the classic Cake Eating Problem. The first file instead is a routine that solves the Brock-Mirman model with Value Function Interpolation and Quadrature to approximate expectations.

## 7. Other Projects

This last folder containts other projects I think may be interesting.
